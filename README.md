## 🧩 Project Overview

**ESTIM** simulates a digital distribution platform for video games.  
Users can create accounts, browse games, add them to a shopping cart, complete mock purchases, and post reviews.  
Distributors can publish games and access basic sales statistics.

This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate:
- Object-Oriented Programming principles (OOP)
- Use of at least **two design patterns** (e.g., Singleton and Factory)
- Integration with a **relational database** (SQLite)
- RESTful API design and automated testing
- Basic CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**
