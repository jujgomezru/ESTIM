This document includes:

### User requirements

We have defined 18 **Functional requirements** and 12 **Non-functional requirements** for the definition of our project. The objective of said requirements, is to create a functional parody of the popular game platform Steam, without significantly exceeding the development purposes of the Software Engineering II course. 

### User stories

We defined illustrative User Stories based on the main functionality of the project. We selected the 17 most relevant User Stories, in order to explain the main functions we aim to achieve in the development of our project.

### User story mapping

We use the online platform Miro to create 3 User Story Mapping diagrams, following the directives defined in class. The diagrams are separated based on the intented role: **User**, **Publisher** and **Administrator**. They each follow the conceptual flow of Activity -- User Stories -- Tasks

1. **User Requirements** — high-level goals and system description  
2. **User Stories** — detailed user interactions and acceptance criteria  
3. **User Story Mapping** — organization of stories across features and priorities
